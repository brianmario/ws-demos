Just trying to do something simple with websockets, a few different ways using:

1. [Raw HTML/JS](frontend/raw/index.html)
2. [HTMX](frontend/htmx/index.html)
3. [React](frontend/react/src)

This assumes you have the [backend rails](backend) app booted up (which is the websocket server for these examples).
